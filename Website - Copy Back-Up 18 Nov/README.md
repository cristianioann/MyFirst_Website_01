# MyFirst_Website_01
I want to learn how do I optimize my files and how do I create html and css files which can be included in index.html and styles.css and
act as a One Page Website

Basically I want to take the files index.html and styles.css which have quite a lot of code for me and to split those in smaller,
more accessible files. The problem is that I don't know what is the "good practice" for that and how do I manage to access the index.html
and to see all the html files loaded on the same page.
